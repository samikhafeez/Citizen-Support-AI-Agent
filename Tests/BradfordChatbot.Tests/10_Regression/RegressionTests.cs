// Category 10: Regression tests for known historical failures
//
// Each test here documents a specific bug that occurred in a previous session
// and verifies it remains fixed. When adding a new regression test:
//  1. Add a comment explaining which bug it covers
//  2. Reference the session or date if known
//  3. Keep the test name descriptive
//
// KNOWN REGRESSIONS COVERED:
//  R1  – "hi" after a Council Tax answer → should NOT be classified as Council Tax
//  R2  – "idk" → should NOT return random Blue Badge content
//  R3  – "sdfsadf" → should NOT return random Library content
//  R4  – "I am [NAME]" → should NOT route to Housing
//  R5  – "How do I apply for council tax support?" → should NOT return student discount
//  R6  – "What help is available for disabled people?" → should NOT route to Council Tax
//  R7  – "How do I apply late?" in Education context → should NOT go to Benefits
//  R8  – "How can I contact the council?" → should NOT fall into generic clarification
//  R9  – "I am at risk of eviction" → should NOT be caught by name-introduction guard
//  R10 – Suggestion chips as single words → should NOT loop user back to clarification
//  R11 – Appointment type selection: "I am applying" during flow → should escape
//  R12 – "I need help paying bills" → should NOT be caught by vague-help guard
//  R13 – "When is my bin collection?" first turn → must route to Waste & Bins, NOT clarification
//  R14 – "check my bin collection" first turn → must route to Waste & Bins, NOT clarification
//  R15 – Short bin query (≤5 words) with known service → must NOT hit clarification else-if
//  R16 – Session reset: new session must not inherit stale pendingFlow from previous session
//  R17 – Parser failure must NOT say "not eligible"; message should direct to website
